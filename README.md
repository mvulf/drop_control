# Droplet Generator optimal control
The **goal** of this project is to create an optimal control of the droplet generator (it's hydraulic part) by Reinforcement Learning.

## Content
- Current main notebook with a detailed description of the Droplet Generation System is introduced in the root of the repository ([reinforce_hydraulic_system.ipynb](https://github.com/mvulf/drop_control/blob/main/reinforce_hydraulic_system.ipynb))
